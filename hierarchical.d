/**
This file contains functions for performing hierarchical clustering, and
can be used for drawing heatmaps and, eventually, dendrograms.

Bugs:  Not very efficient, though it probably doesn't need to be because
       the use case is visualizations, and all the information has to fit
       reasonably on the visualization.  Therefore, N will always be fairly
       small.
